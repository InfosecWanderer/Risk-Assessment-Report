# Security Risk Assessment Report

## Description

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of security vulnerabilities identified within a social media organization following a significant data breach. The primary objective is to implement effective network hardening practices to prevent future incidents and protect customer personal information. The report details the major vulnerabilities discovered, proposes targeted hardening methods to address these issues, and provides actionable recommendations for enhancing security management.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities were identified during the assessment:

1. **Password Sharing Among Employees**  
   Employees are sharing passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

2. **Default Admin Password for the Database**  
   The database's admin password has not been changed from its default setting, making it susceptible to attacks.

3. **Insufficient Firewall Configuration**  
   Firewalls currently lack rules to adequately filter incoming and outgoing traffic, exposing the network to potential threats.

4. **Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   The organization does not utilize MFA, which reduces the security of user accounts.

If these vulnerabilities remain unaddressed, the organization risks experiencing further data breaches and potential reputational damage.

## Part 1: Hardening Tools and Methods

### Effective Hardening Tasks

1. **Enforce Unique, Strong Passwords and Educate Employees**
   - **Action Steps**:
     - Implement a strong password policy that requires a minimum length, complexity (combination of letters, numbers, and symbols), and regular password rotation (every 3-6 months).
     - Conduct training sessions on the importance of password security and the dangers of sharing passwords, emphasizing best practices.
   - **Tools and Technologies**:
     - **Password Management Tools**: LastPass, 1Password, or Bitwarden for managing and generating strong passwords.
     - **Employee Training Platforms**: KnowBe4 or Cybrary for security awareness training.

2. **Secure Database Access**
   - **Action Steps**:
     - Enforce privilege escalation prevention protocols for the database administrator account.
     - Implement strong password policies and least privilege access control (LPAC) for all database accounts, ensuring that users have only the necessary permissions.
   - **Tools and Technologies**:
     - **Database Security Tools**: Imperva or IBM Guardium for database activity monitoring and security.
     - **Access Management Solutions**: Okta or Azure Active Directory for managing user permissions and access controls.

3. **Regular Firewalls Maintenance**
   - **Action Steps**:
     - Configure firewalls to include specific inbound and outbound filtering rules based on the organization’s security policies.
     - Schedule regular reviews and updates of firewall configurations to block unnecessary connections and adapt to new threats.
   - **Tools and Technologies**:
     - **Firewall Solutions**: Cisco ASA, Fortinet FortiGate, or Palo Alto Networks for advanced firewall capabilities.
     - **Network Monitoring Tools**: SolarWinds or Wireshark for monitoring network traffic and firewall effectiveness.

4. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - **Action Steps**:
     - Implement MFA for all user accounts, requiring additional verification methods (e.g., SMS codes, authentication apps) alongside passwords.
   - **Tools and Technologies**:
     - **MFA Solutions**: Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Duo Security for implementing multi-factor authentication.

## Part 2: Recommendations

### Effective Hardening Practices

1. **Enforcing Strong Password Policy with MFA**
   - **Effectiveness**: This combination directly addresses two critical vulnerabilities—shared passwords and lack of MFA—making unauthorized access significantly more difficult.
   - **Implementation Frequency**: Enforce during account creation and conduct periodic reviews every 3-6 months to ensure compliance.

2. **Least Privilege Access Control (LPAC) and Database Hardening**
   - **Effectiveness**: Limiting user permissions minimizes the potential damage if an account is compromised, and hardening the database protects sensitive information.
   - **Implementation Frequency**: Implement for all user accounts immediately, with regular reviews (quarterly) to adjust permissions as necessary. Database hardening measures should be reassessed semi-annually.

3. **Firewall Rule Implementation**
   - **Effectiveness**: Well-defined firewall rules restrict unauthorized access, helping to prevent malware infiltration and other attacks.
   - **Implementation Frequency**: Initial configurations should be completed promptly, with continuous monitoring and updates performed quarterly or as new threats emerge.

## Summary

In summary, this report identifies critical security vulnerabilities within the organization and outlines effective hardening methods to mitigate risks. By enforcing strong password policies, securing database access, maintaining robust firewall configurations, and implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), the organization can significantly enhance its security posture. The recommendations provided aim to establish a comprehensive framework for preventing future data breaches and protecting customer information, ultimately fostering trust and compliance within the organization.
